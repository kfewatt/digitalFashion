            <p>CONSUMERS</p>
            Constantly shifting trends that feature on the high street have made way for cheap, low quality garments that satisfy the consumers' wish to be on trend whilst creating huge profit for the companies who sell them. The popularity of this manner of consuming - buying lots of garments cheaply and often - can also be attributed to the relatively recent concept of "influencing" on social media. Influencers have been known to buy a piece of clothing simply to post on their social media, encouraging their thousands of followers to do the same. In order to reverse this process, or rather slow it down, a movement of "slow" fashion has emerged, a movement focussing on buying high quality garments that are intended to last and therefore decrease the demand for the manufactoring of new clothing in future. Though a higher quality garment may mean higher prices in the short term, it reduces the need for excess purchasing in the futre - meaning long term this attitude toward shopping may save money and the planet. What is needed from the public is a change in attitude. We need a refusal to follow fast fashion's trends and tolerate companies that profit from destruction and, oftem, mistreat or underpay their workers.

        <div class = "row">
            <p>PRODUCERS</p>
             It's up to the corporations who deal this damage to correct it. A focus on better quality materials such recycled cotton or linen rather than acrylic or polyester. They can reduce the number of collection releases they perform throughout the year in order to emcourage infrequent purchasing. Importantly too, they must pay their employees a living wage, as many of them currently do not, leaving the workers forced to work long hours and adversely affect their health both physically and mentally. Many work in poor conditions with little other choice. As one company changing their ways is not enough, it is important for them all to be transparent about their spending and their actions so that the public can hold them accountable and they can encourage eachother to increase their wages and reduce their textile wastage.
